                        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
                        If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
                        they've moved <a href="#">to their own section</a>. Continue reading 
                        for an introduction to the documentation, Native Components,
                        React, and more!

                        React Native is an open source framework for
                        building Android and iOS applications using
                        React and the app platform’s native capabiles.
                        With React Native, you use JavaScript to access
                        your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the
                        appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                        <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about
                        React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how
                        components work in React Native.

                        React Native runs on <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>, a popular open source
                        library for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
                        To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
                        This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                            uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
                            creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.

                        <p>
                            React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
                            you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                            <mark>&ltText&gt Hello, I am your cat! &lt/Text&gt </mark>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The React docs have <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a>
                            you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
                            you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring
                            a <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark>&ltText&gt</mark>
                        </p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>props.</summary>
                        <p>
                            Props is short for “properties”.
                        </p>

                    <details>
                        <summary>state.</summary>
                        <p>
                            While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                            configure how components render, state is like a component’s
                            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                            changes over time or that comes from user interaction.
                            State gives your components memory!

                    <h2 id="handling-text-input">handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
                        It has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called
                        every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
                        their words into a different language. In this new language,
                        every single word is written the same way: &#127829.
                        So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829 &#127829".
